# CSS Advanced – SmileSchool Clone

I rebuilt the SmileSchool landing page using only HTML and CSS.  
I received a Figma file with the full visual specs (colors, spacing, typography, assets) and had to reproduce the page as closely as possible.

## What I did
- Recreated the entire layout from the Figma mockup (hero, testimonials, videos, membership, FAQ, footer).
- Matched the typography, spacing, gradients, and icon placement using plain CSS.
- Used semantic HTML structure with reusable utility classes (e.g., `.highlight`, `.italic`).
- Ensured the hero banner and quote block stretch edge-to-edge like the design while other sections stay centered.

## How to view
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Navigate to `css_advanced/`.
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.

Everything is static, so no additional build step is required.

## File structure
- `index.html` – semantic markup for every section.
- `styles.css` – complete styling (typography, positioning, responsive tweaks).
- `images/` – assets exported from the Figma file (logos, avatars, icons).

## Notes
- The project intentionally avoids frameworks to focus on core CSS skills.
- All dimensions and colors follow the provided Figma specs.
- Adjustments (like spacing tweaks) were done manually to match the screenshot precisely.

Feel free to reuse pieces of this layout for other practice projects. If you spot any visual mismatch with the original mockup, let me know!
